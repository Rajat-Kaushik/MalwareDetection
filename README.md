In today’s world, everything is dependent on the internet in some way or another. The growing cyber world has brought a lot of new inventions and made our life easier than ever. The year 2020 has shut down all the offline markets, thus the user base of all the online applications has grown rapidly. From a kindergarten-going child to a B.Tech student, everyone is on the internet to attend their education, offices have moved to Work from Home culture. As a result, the risk of cybercrimes and hacking has increased and internet users are now more prone to be the victims of these attacks.


Malware is a piece of software, that is installed on the victim’s computer, which harms the systems and collects important data. Malware is of many types such as Viruses, worms, ransomware, adware, spyware, and trojan horse.
