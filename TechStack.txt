1. Building of the Website 
  1.1 FrontEnd Development
      1.1.1 HTML : HTML is the language in which most websites are written.HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
                   Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
                   A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

      Files Names :--> 

      Index.html : This is the Page where we are uploading the file for the Scanning.
      result.html : This is the Page used for showing the result of the SCanning that the file is Malicious Or Not.

      1.1.2 CSS : Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
      CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
      CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
      
      Files Names :--> 
      style.css 
      styless.css 

      1.1.3 JavaScript :JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. 
      It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
 
      Files Names :-->
      index.js :--> It is used for the Js in the Main Page where we are uploading the .exe Files.
      main.js :--> It is used for the JS in the Main Page where the Nav Scrolls , for the Preloader,
      for the Drag and Drop Option and for the Pop Up in the Main Page.
     
      1.1.4 Jquery :-->
      jquery.magnific-popup.js :--> It is used for Popup which is there in the First Page of the 
      detection.

  1.2 BackEnd Development 

      1.2.1 Flask : 
      Files Names :
      Checker.py : This is the main Flask File where all the Routes for the index.html file.
      Using this file only the POST of the .exe file is done to the backend server.
      It is responsinle for the calculation of the Entropy of all the algorithm used in the programs.
      It is also responsible for extracting all the Data from the .exe file for scanning that .exe file on the 
      basis of all the features which we have definned in the App.
      Here we have also definned and Extracted the Resources to the main app.
      
      learning.py : The Main purpose of this file is that it is extracting Data from the Data.csv file and using the algorithm the training of the Algorithm , 
      sorting of the data on the basis of the indices.
      Here all the ALgorithm Classifiers are called for the Training of the ALgorithm and to get to know the most efficient 
      ALgorithm using the features which have been definned in the DataSet.
      Prediction of the Algorithm is also used.
 
      pickleread.py : This is a pickleread file uses the classifier.pkl files.
      The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. 
      “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, 
      whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. 

 2. Docker 
    Docker is a container management service. 
    The keywords of Docker are develop, ship and run anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.
    Docker Compose − This is used to define applications using multiple Docker containers.  
    Docker Files -- A Dockerfile is a text document that contains commands that are used to assemble an image. We can use any command that call on the command line. 
    Docker builds images automatically by reading the instructions from the Dockerfile.
    
    Files Names :--> 
    Docker-compose.yml
    DockerFile 

 3. DevOps Tools used :
    3.1 GitHub : Here all the Repository is there and working of all the members in the Group.
    GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
    
    Files Names :--> 
     .git
     .gitignore   

    3.2 Jenkins:  It is a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Tool.
    As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.
    In our project the main use of the jenkins is when anyone gives a wrong commit in the respository than all the team members are going to get Email named that the Build has been Failed.
    And if the Commi is successfull than all our going to get the mail that the Build was completed.

    Build Tools used 

    3.3 PYB BUilder : PyBuilder is a software build automation tool written in pure Python mainly targeting Python ecosystem. 
    It is based on the concept of dependency-based programming but also comes along with powerful plugin mechanism that allows the construction of 
    build life-cycles similar to those known from other famous build tools like Apache Maven and Gradle.
    This is the whole Directory which the PyBuilder is going to make .

 4. Testing Tools Used :
    4.1 Selenium Testing : Selenium is a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. 
     You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python etc to create Selenium Test Scripts. 
     Testing done using the Selenium testing tool is usually referred to as Selenium Testing.

    4.2 PyTest : Pytest is a python based testing framework, which is used to write and execute test codes. 
                 In the present days of REST services, pytest is mainly used for API testing even though we can use pytest to write simple to complex tests, 
                 i.e., we can write codes to test API, database, UI, etc.
